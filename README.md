# World of Modding
A world of goo clone designed for modding  

---------------------------------------------

Made by fans of the great World of Goo, it's a remake of the World of Goo mechanics with built-in levels and
highly moddable content.<br>
It ***will*** have customizable levels, goo balls, particles, button actions, cutscenes and custom tools specially built for this, 
linked together with the the game itself.

If you want to support this, join [this discord](https://discord.gg/suJjpre "World of Modding Development Server") and
maybe [the goofans server](https://discord.gg/S4mtbT "Goofans Discord") in general.

This is currently still in development, if you want to participate in it, contact us on the World of Modding Development Discord 
given upwards. 

------------------------------------------------ 

If you want to support World of Goo and their developer, go and buy World of Goo or one of the newer games made by [Tomorrow 
Corporation](https://tomorrowcorporation.com "Tomorrow Corporation's homepage"). 

Also we don't try pirating World of Goo 
or something like that, an installation of World of Goo is probably going to be required to run this anyway, since this will use 
some assets of the game, like fonts
